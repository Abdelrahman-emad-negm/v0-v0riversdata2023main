# Breathing River - Environmental Conservation Platform

A comprehensive web application dedicated to raising awareness about the world's most important rivers and promoting environmental conservation through community engagement.

## Overview

Breathing River is an interactive platform that combines education, action, and impact tracking to address critical environmental challenges facing our planet's major river systems. The platform serves three distinct user groups—students, adults, and farmers—each with specialized tools and resources tailored to their unique role in environmental conservation.

## Key Features

### River Information Hub
Detailed, data-driven pages about major rivers including:
- **Amazon River**: Real-time drought monitoring, deforestation impact analysis, and biodiversity tracking
- **Nile River**: Water scarcity data, agricultural impact studies, and historical context
- **Yangtze River**: Pollution levels, dam impact assessments, and conservation efforts

Each river page includes:
- Interactive environmental data visualizations
- Historical context and current challenges
- Conservation initiatives and success stories
- Dark mode support for comfortable viewing

### Tree Management System
**For Farmers** - Plant Tree Verification:
- Upload before/after photos of tree planting activities
- AI-powered image analysis using green pixel detection
- Automatic tree count verification
- Environmental impact calculations (CO2 absorption, oxygen production)
- Beautiful results display with gradient animations

**For Adults** - Add Existing Trees:
- Register existing trees in the environmental monitoring system
- Same verification technology as farmer planting
- Track cumulative environmental impact
- Contribute to community forest mapping

### Water Conservation Tracking
Interactive tools for adults to monitor and reduce water consumption:
- Daily activity tracking (showering, brushing teeth, washing dishes, laundry)
- Real-time water usage calculations
- Personalized conservation tips
- Progress tracking and goal setting

### Educational Resources
**For Students**:
- Interactive quizzes about river ecosystems
- Educational games teaching water conservation
- Age-appropriate content about environmental science
- Engaging visual learning experiences

### Community Action
- Cleaning Campaigns: Organize and participate in river cleanup events
- Impact Dashboard: View collective environmental contributions
- Success Stories: Share and celebrate conservation achievements

## Technical Architecture

### Frontend Stack
- **Framework**: Next.js 15 with App Router for optimal performance and SEO
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS v4 with custom design tokens
- **UI Components**: shadcn/ui for consistent, accessible components
- **Typography**: Geist Sans, Geist Mono, Playfair Display, and Oswald fonts
- **Theme**: Full dark mode support with seamless switching
- **Animations**: Smooth transitions and gradient effects for engaging UX

### Image Processing
- **Client-Side Analysis**: Browser-based green pixel counting for tree detection
- **Canvas API**: Real-time image processing without server dependencies
- **Algorithm**: Analyzes RGB values to identify vegetation and calculate tree coverage
- **Performance**: Instant results with no backend latency

### Key Technologies
- TypeScript for type safety and developer experience
- React 19 with modern hooks and patterns
- Responsive design supporting all device sizes
- Optimized images and assets for fast loading
- Accessibility-first component design
